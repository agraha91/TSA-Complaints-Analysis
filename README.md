**Project Title:** TSA Complaints Analysis
**Completion Date:** May 2025

**Overview**
This project analyzes complaints submitted to the TSA to identify common themes, trends over time, and regional variation. The dataset includes complaint type, location, and date fields. The analysis aims to surface areas of public concern and offer insights for improving passenger experience.

**Objectives**

- Classify and visualize the most frequent TSA complaint categories.
- Identify peaks in complaint volume over time.
- Explore geographic differences in complaint patterns.

**Methods**

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Standardized categories and filtered out missing data.
- Exploratory Analysis: Frequency counts, bar plots, time series trends.
- Geospatial Analysis: Mapping complaint volume by U.S. state or airport.

**Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Geopandas)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Key Findings**
- Most common complaints related to screening procedures and customer service.
- Spikes in complaint volume occurred during holiday travel months.
- Certain airports and states showed higher complaint rates per capita.

**Ethical Considerations**
- Public dataset used without identifying information.
- Aimed at service improvement, not blame.
